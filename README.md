# NeuralNetworks
A collection of neural network projects to investigate how they operate.

NNScratch is the first project I undertook and aims to explore the main aspects of Neural Networks.

NN_Digit_Identifier is the second project I undertook is a Neural Network built without using keras, tensorflow or pytorch. The network identifes digits using the mnist digit dataset. It explains the linear algebra behind the layers and setting hyperparameters.
